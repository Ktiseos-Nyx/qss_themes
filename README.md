# QSS Themes: Deconstruction of Perfection

> *"In a world of sterile minimalism and corporate-approved design language, we choose chaos, personality, and the wild west of digital self-expression."*

## Philosophy

Modern design has become homogenized, sanitized, and soul-crushingly uniform. Every app looks the same, every interface follows the same "best practices," and we've lost the beautiful chaos of personal customization that made computing personal.

**This collection rebels against that.**

These themes embrace the wild west era of computer customization - when your desktop was YOUR space, when geocities pages hurt your eyes in the best way possible, and when software had personality instead of focus-group-tested blandness.

## The Collection

### 🌟 **Geocities Deux** - Starfield Edition
The ultimate "so bad it's good" aesthetic. Semi-transparent widgets let a tiling starfield background shine through, while maintaining just enough readability to be functional. Peak 90s web design energy. Current limitation of QSS means that the PNG system and the starfield isn't working. 

### 🎮 **Final Fantasy 6 Classic** (Windows 3.1 Blue)
Inspired by the menu systems of classic JRPGs. Deep blues, clean lines, and that satisfying "click" feeling of well-designed interfaces before everything became flat and boring.

### 🌈 **Geocities Nightmare** 
The original geocities theme with maximum 90s assault. Bright colors, garish gradients, and that authentic "my first website" energy. Not for the faint of heart.

### 🤖 **Cyberpunk 2077**
Matrix-green text on black backgrounds. Uppercase buttons with neon borders. Channel your inner hacker with this terminal-aesthetic theme that screams "I'm in the mainframe."

### 🔮 **Vaporwave Aesthetic** 
Pink-to-blue gradients, cyan borders, and that A E S T H E T I C feeling. Rounded buttons and spacing that says "I miss the 80s that never existed."

### 🕷️ **Hide (Pink Spider)** - Visual Kei Theme
Dark backgrounds with hot pink accents. Inspired by Japanese visual kei bands and the gothic-kawaii aesthetic. Dramatic gradients meet bold typography.

### 🌸 **Kawaii Pastel Overload**
Rainbow pastel gradients that would make a unicorn jealous. Rounded buttons, soft colors, and maximum cute overload. Perfect for when you want your interface to feel like a magical girl transformation.

### 💿 **AOL Classic** 
Authentic late-90s AOL client aesthetics. That distinctive blue header, yellow highlights, and the nostalgia of dial-up internet. "You've got mail" energy in theme form.

### 🌙 **Facebook Dark**
Modern Facebook's dark mode color scheme. For when you want social media aesthetics without the social media drama.

### 🍎 **Mac 90s Greyscale**
Classic monochrome Mac interface vibes. Clean, minimal, and channeling that early PowerMac energy before everything got colorful.

### 🪟 **Windows Vista (Aero-inspired)**
Translucent blues and that distinctive "glass" effect. Bringing back the controversial beauty of Vista's Aero interface - love it or hate it, it was definitely memorable.

### 🦊 **Firefox Classic**
Authentic early-2000s Firefox browser aesthetics. Tan backgrounds, subtle gradients, and that comfortable feeling of browsing the web before everything became "flat design."

### 🪟 **Windows Modern** 
Contemporary Windows 10/11 inspired theming for those who want familiarity with their chaos.

### 🪟 **Windows XP**
Bliss wallpaper energy in theme form. Blue taskbars, rounded buttons, and that distinctive early-2000s Microsoft aesthetic.

### 🎭 **macOS 00s** 
Early Mac OS X aqua button aesthetics and that distinctive brushed metal look.

## Font Recommendations

**Important:** Fonts cannot be hardcoded into QSS themes due to Qt limitations. You'll need to set these in your application's font settings.

### Recommended Font Pairings:

- **Final Fantasy 6 Theme**: 
  - **Silkscreen** (primary recommendation) - Perfect pixelated aesthetic
  - **PixelifySans** (alternative) - Clean pixel font with better readability
  
- **Geocities Themes**:
  - **PixelifySans** - Maintains readability while staying period-appropriate
  - **Silkscreen** - For maximum authenticity (may impact readability)

- **Other themes**: TBD as collection grows

## Installation & Usage

1. Download the desired `.qss` file
2. Place it in your application's themes directory
3. Apply through your application's theme manager
4. Set recommended fonts in your application's font settings for optimal experience

**Note:** If your application uses qt-material themes, you may need to disable material theming first to prevent conflicts.

## Technical Notes

- All themes use semi-transparent backgrounds where possible
- Asset paths are included for background images (Warning: These MAY NOT WORK with QSS files)
- RGBA color values are used for maximum compatibility
- Themes are designed to be readable while maintaining their aesthetic integrity
