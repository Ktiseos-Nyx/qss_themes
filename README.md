# QSS Themes: Deconstruction of Perfection

> *"In a world of sterile minimalism and corporate-approved design language, we choose chaos, personality, and the wild west of digital self-expression."*

## Philosophy

Modern design has become homogenized, sanitized, and soul-crushingly uniform. Every app looks the same, every interface follows the same "best practices," and we've lost the beautiful chaos of personal customization that made computing personal.

**This collection rebels against that.**

These themes embrace the wild west era of computer customization - when your desktop was YOUR space, when geocities pages hurt your eyes in the best way possible, and when software had personality instead of focus-group-tested blandness.

## The Collection

### ðŸŒŸ **Geocities Deux** - Starfield Edition
The ultimate "so bad it's good" aesthetic. Semi-transparent widgets let a tiling starfield background shine through, while maintaining just enough readability to be functional. Peak 90s web design energy.

### ðŸŽ® **Final Fantasy 6 Classic** (Windows 3.1 Blue)
Inspired by the menu systems of classic JRPGs. Deep blues, clean lines, and that satisfying "click" feeling of well-designed interfaces before everything became flat and boring.

### ðŸŽ¨ **[Additional themes as they're added]**

## Font Recommendations

**Important:** Fonts cannot be hardcoded into QSS themes due to Qt limitations. You'll need to set these in your application's font settings.

### Recommended Font Pairings:

- **Final Fantasy 6 Theme**: 
  - **Silkscreen** (primary recommendation) - Perfect pixelated aesthetic
  - **PixelifySans** (alternative) - Clean pixel font with better readability
  
- **Geocities Themes**:
  - **PixelifySans** - Maintains readability while staying period-appropriate
  - **Silkscreen** - For maximum authenticity (may impact readability)

- **Other themes**: TBD as collection grows

## Installation & Usage

1. Download the desired `.qss` file
2. Place it in your application's themes directory
3. Apply through your application's theme manager
4. Set recommended fonts in your application's font settings for optimal experience

**Note:** If your application uses qt-material themes, you may need to disable material theming first to prevent conflicts.

## Technical Notes

- All themes use semi-transparent backgrounds where possible
- Asset paths are included for background images (ensure assets folder is present)
- RGBA color values are used for maximum compatibility
- Themes are designed to be readable while maintaining their aesthetic integrity
